# chess.py
A chess engine in python. Yep. Who would've thought!

It uses a bitboard technique which would be very fast in something like c++... but python's dynamic integer sizes don't do it any favours. 

This project is basically an easy to understand version of chess.cpp! 

chess.py uses its own GUI system built on top of pygame.
