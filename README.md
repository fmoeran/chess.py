# chess.py
A chess engine in python. Yep. Who would've thought!

It uses a bitboard technique which would be very fast in something like c++... but python's dynamic integer sizes don't do it any favours. 

This project is basically an easy to understand version of chess.cpp!

## Requirements

```
>>> pip install pygame
>>> pip install gmpy2
>>> pip install tqdm
```
